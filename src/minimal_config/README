The build process allows you to use predefined configuration files for the
kernel and for BusyBox. This is what you need to do in order to use your own
predefined configuration files:

1) First of all you need to have '.config' configuration file. The assumption is
   that you already know what '.config' file is and how it is used during the
   kernel & BusyBox build process. Take the '.config', place it in this folder
   and finally rename the file. The predefined configuration file name is:
   
   kernel.config  - for kernel (obviously)
   busybox.config - for BusyBox (what a surprise)
   
2) Change the corresponding property in the main '.config' (that's the minimal's 
   config file) to value 'true':

   USE_PREDEFINED_KERNEL_CONFIG  - for kernel
   
   USE_PREDEFINED_BUSYBOX_CONFIG - for BusyBox

3) That's it. Now during the build process instead of generating default
   '.config' files, the predefined configuration files will be used, That's
   particularly useful if you want to experiment with many non-default config
   options. In this case it's easier to use configuration file instead of using
   the scripts in order to generate tons of options. Another useful scenario is
   when you distribute your OS based on 'Minimal Linux Live' and you want to use
   non-default kernel and/or BusyBox options 'out of the box'.
