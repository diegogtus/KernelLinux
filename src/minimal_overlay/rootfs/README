This file can be found in the folder 'minimal_overlay/rootfs'.

You can use this folder to put your own content (files and folders) which will
be visible in the root folder of your 'Minimal Linux Live' system, just like
this file is visible. The files/folders will override the content in the root
folder, so be careful what you put there because you may end up with broken
system. If the boot media is writeable, then all changes on the root file system
are persisted automatically, so be very careful what you do when you use the
overlay support.

Check the '.config' file in the source folder for more details on the overlay
options and how to use them.
